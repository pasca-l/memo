## Installing Poetry
- With official installer
1. Download and install with python3.7 and above.
```bash
$ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Add Poetry to PATH, the wrapper is created at `$HOME/.local/bin` on Unix, or the binary file is at `~/.local/share/pypoetry/venv/bin/poetry` on Linux/Unix.
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

3. Poetry is able to update itself when installed by the official installer.
```bash
$ poetry self update
```

- With [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
0. Install pipx, on Linux.
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user pipx
$ python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# upgrade pipx
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pipx
```

1. Install using pipx.
```bash
$ pipx install poetry
```

2. Update Poetry.
```bash
$ pipx upgrade poetry
```

## Installing dependencies
- Resolves and installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml` from the project. If `poetry.lock` file present, exact dependency resolution will be used.
```bash
# with dependencies from group dev
$ poetry install --with dev
```

- Add package and installs it.
```bash
$ poetry add --group dev black
```

## Configuring Poetry
Configuration file `config.toml` will be automatically created after running `poetry config` command, under `~/.config/pypoetry` on Unix.

```bash
$ poetry config --list
```
```
cache-dir = "/path/to/cache/directory"
virtualenvs.create = true
virtualenvs.in-project = null
virtualenvs.options.always-copy = true
virtualenvs.options.no-pip = false
virtualenvs.options.no-setuptools = false
virtualenvs.options.system-site-packages = false
virtualenvs.path = "{cache-dir}/virtualenvs"
virtualenvs.prefer-active-python = false
virtualenvs.prompt = "{project_name}-py{python_version}"
```

- If `virtualenvs.create` is `false`, and detects no enabled or existing virtual environment in `{cache-dir}/virtualenvs` or `{project-dir}/.venv`, Poetry will install dependencies into the python environment of the system.
  - For Docker containers that require dependencies on the python environment of the image, virtual environment should not be created.

## List available packages
List all available packages, or pass the package name to show detail of a certain package.
```bash
$ poetry show --tree
```

## Creating `pyproject.toml` file
`pyproject.toml` should be prepared or created for the project.
