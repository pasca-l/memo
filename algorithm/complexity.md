## Big-O notation
Big-O, referred as "order of", expresses the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.

| order | example algorithm |
| --- | --- |
| O(1) | list access, etc. |
| O(logn) | binary search, etc. |
| O(n) | linear search, etc. |
| O(nlogn) | merge sort, etc. |
| O(n^2) | selection sort, insertion sort, etc. |
| O(n^3) | matrix multiplication, etc. |
| O(2^n) | Knapsack problem, etc. |
| O(n!) | Traveling salesman problem, etc. |
